# CM523 Midterm - Code Review

In this portion of the exam, you will do a code review of my code. There are three things I'm having trouble with in my pull request. Explain each error by commenting on the appropriate line on the pull request in Github, and what I need to do to fix it. (This is the same thing I do to give you feedback on your code!)

For extra credit: identify at least one way I could improve my code readability, accessibility, maintainability, or style, and explain how it would help you read and understand my code better as a fellow developer.
