# CM523 Midterm - Code Review

In this portion of the exam, you will do a code review of my code. There are three things I'm having trouble with in my pull request. Explain each error by commenting on the appropriate line on the pull request in Github, and what I need to do to fix it. (This is the same thing I do to give you feedback on your code!)

**For extra credit:** identify and recommend at least one way I could improve my code readability, accessibility, maintainability, or style, and explain how it would help you read and understand my code better as a fellow developer, or spot a bug or something I missed in my CSS. There's plenty I could improve in here!

## How to do the code review

### Run the Start Code Review action

This will create a sample code review for you to review in your repository. 

**Create an issue - any issue! - in this repository.** It doesn't matter what you put in it. There is a bug in Github right now with actions that prevents me from giving you proper instructions to do this, so - I'm using issues to tell Github to set this up for you as a workaround. [You can use the instructions here.](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue)

Head to Actions to see how that sample pull request is coming along.

### Begin reviewing the code

Open the pull request, and use Github's code review tools to comment on the code where it can be improved. Be sure to identify any possible solutions to where the person is struggling!
